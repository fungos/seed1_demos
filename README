A collection of demos using Seed Framework

This is the base for learning how to use Seed Framework and are valid as tests while 
we does not have unity tests. We will add more and more demos here and improve Seed
documentation based on these demos. The demos must work on every supported platform
and must avoid any type of conditional compilation.

On Linux run make-project.sh to build all demos after setting you SEEDSDK environment
variable and compiling Seed.
